# SDP Convening 2015 
Slides, example .ado files, and diff example from SDP 2015 Convening workshop.

The workshop attempted to show different ways in which common tasks could be wrapped into executable programs written in Stata.  This was also the start of development on the `brewscheme` package to develop customized scheme files.
